# Hello, I'm Vijay Singh!

Coding isn't just a skill for meâ€”it's a passion that fuels my every day. Every bug I fix, every feature I build, and every line of code I write brings me one step closer to becoming the engineer I aspire to be.

 **My Journey So Far:**
- I built my foundation in classes 11th and 12th at **Matrix, Sikar**.
- Scored **95 percentile in JEE Mains**.
-Currently pursuing engineering at **B K Birla Institute of Engineering & Technology, Pilani**.

 **What I'm Learning:**
-  Web Development 
-  DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)
-  System Design & Core CS Concepts (OS, DBMS, CN, OOPs)
-  Exploring the world of **Generative AI**

I believe in learning by building. I'm continuously working on projects that help me grow and challenge myself.

 Thanks a lot for visiting my GitHub! I truly appreciate your time and support. Wishing you endless success and happiness on your own journey. ðŸ™Œ

Let's connect and grow together!
